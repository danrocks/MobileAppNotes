<h1>Useful Git knowledge</h1>
<h2>Mac</h2>
    <p>
        Git should be run from the <strong>Terminal</strong>.
        Start by navigating to the local git repository folder (make a git folder by importing from remote and running git init).
    </p>
    <p>
        The terminal can also be used to create files with "touch myNewFile.xxx"
    </p>
    <p>
        A good synopsis is <a href="http://www.mattboldt.com/using-git-for-websites/">Using Git for WebSites</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        To commit and push changes (<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/">here</a>):
    </p>
    <p>
        Add the files to be committed. This stages them for the first commit.
        <br />
        $ git add .
    </p>
    <p>
        Commit the files that you've staged in your local repository.
        <br />
        $ git commit -m "commit notes"
    </p>
    <p>
        Push the changes in your local repository to GitHub.
        $ git push -u origin master
    </p>

    <h2>Cloning</h2>
    <p>
        I recently had cause to pull files originally created on my MAC into Windows (the files were already in GitHub).
    </p>
    <p>
        Github's Clone button worked really smoothly, although I did note it chose it's own
        target directory. I expect there is a way to pick my own directory structure but it isn't immediately obvious.
    </p>


    <h2>Win 10 - VS2015 - Initial Commit</h2>
    <p>
    VS2015 makes it pretty easy to submit a new repository to github. In Team Explorer simply seek out "Create"
        and complete the short, sensible form. Obviously there is a dependency on having Git Extensions installed
        and a github account
    </p>
    <p>
        Without VS/GitExtensions the best way seems to be to create new repository directly on Github. Thien clone this 
        and add your new data before commiting and syncing
    </p>

 <h2>Win 10 - VS2015 - Normal Commit</h2>
    <p>
        VS does make it quite simple to commit changes and push them to github (assuming GitHub has previously been wired up via initial commit or cloning).
    </p>
    <p>
        Simply navigate to the Team Explorer view and click on the changes button.
    </p>
    <p>
        Changed files should be listed - eyeball to make sure there are no surprises. Then provide the commit message.
    </p>
    <p>Once message is provided, "Commmit all" is enabled - hit it.</p>

    <h2>Win 10 - Command line - Normal Commit</h2>
    <p>
        You can always use git from the command line...Start by navigating to your existing git repository (the one with the changes you wish to commit and store)
    </p>
    <p>
       Add files for commit: git add .
    </p>
<p>
       Do Commit: git commit -m "provide a useful message"

    </p>
    <p>
        Push to github: git push -u origin master
    </p>
</body>
