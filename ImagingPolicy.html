<h1>Imaging Policies</h1>
<p>On this page I am trying to collate knowledge about various medical imaging policies. Most policies are a few years old and don't like

<h1>Position Paper</h1>
<h2>Analysis</h2>
<h3>Policy on Recordings (Photography and Video) for Clinical and Service Use</h3>
<p>
There a couple of obvious points around the 2016 "Policy on Recordings (Photography and Video for Clinical and Service Use)".
It does not seem to differ in tone and considerations from the 2008 "Photography and Video Recordings of Patients" policy and procedure
			or the 2011 version of this document.
</p><p>		
Advances in both technology and policy don't seem to have been recognised. In particular:
			</p>
<ul>
	<li>The <a href="http://www.gmc-uk.org/static/documents/content/Making_and_using_visual_and_audio_recordings_of_patients.pdf">
			GMC Guidlines</a> (2011) imply that recording images is a standard part of the care all doctors can provide.
	<li><a href="http://www.gov.scot/Resource/0049/00494144.pdf">A National Clinical Strategy for Scotland</a>
				makes it clear that much wider use of technology is necesary to address the chanlanges that healthcare providers will face 
				in coming years.
	<li>The absolute ubiquity of technology and its ease of use.
</ul>
<p>
It is clear that the Medical Photography Service has a full understanding of the necessity of the issues
			around patient privact and confidentiality
	</p>
<p>
It is clear the Medical Photography Service have taken on more of the responsibilty for photography. Having cross-referenced
			with policy documents from 2008 and 2011 this correlates with an increased side-lining of Primary care issues.
			Clearly a skilled Medical Photography is to be preferred where possible but these are not available in General Practice.
	</p>
<p>
It is notable that this document seems entirely bureaucratic in nature. The management and contributors involved don't
			seem to include few if any persons from clinical or medical background. There doesn't seem to be any patient
			engagement either.
		</p>
<p>
We think is widely understood by GPs that they are never to take photographs. By the same token, the GP is unaware of 
			the section "8.1.1 Exceptions". This would appear to cover child/domestic abuse and, one hopes, instances of
			negligence or other abuse within homes. 
			<br />
			The requirement suggests the Exception applies only to the need for Consent.
			<br />
			The implication is that NHS Lothian will not support a GP recording on evidence of abuse on any tool they have to hand.
			<br />			
			The short treatment of this subject, and the fact it is not widely known, and the unethical and immoral implications
			of it's wording maybe explainable by nature of those who produced the document. This does not mitigate the fact that 
			there is an unacceptable flaw in the policy.
		</p>
<p>
There is a note that procedure "aspects" have been seperated from "policy aspects" - where have they gone.
		</p>
<h3>eHealth Security Policy</h3>
<p>
This is general document outling how information security should work.
A couple of notable sections:
<ul>
	<li> Appendix 4 Computer devices Controls - 1B) no shareware or freeware.
	<li> Appendix 6 Mobile Computer Devices and Media 1a) Only devices purchased or owned by NHS Lothian can be used to store NHS Lothian data.
	<li> Appendix 6 Digital Camaras and Camcorders - seeems consistant bu tnot bother to get policy name right.
	<li> Appendix 8 13/14 Clinical Systems - All the major clinical systems are server based and the servers are to be situated in server rooms.
	<li> Guidance 1 - 2 - AsanemployerNHSLothianiscommittedtoprovidingitsemployeesa working environment safe from bullying...
					an interesting note alongside the threatening nature of the email.
	<li> NHS Lothian will provide...Computer devices and other equipment which will allow staff to work in a efficient and safe manner.
					<br /> Clearly the image capturing aspect is inefficient.
</ul>

<h3>John's Email<h3/>

<h3>Our Email</h3>
<p>
Hi John.
<br /><br />
I've reviewed the policies you sent me. I would say that my colleagues and I take
patient confidentiality, including our responsibilities enshrined in the the data-protection act, 
very seriously. The eHealth Security Policy guides us well in this regard.
We are also happy to work within policies prescribed by the bureaucracy. However, it is not acceptable 
for these policies to be lazily written or to ignore current realities. There maybe a crisis in 
our NHS but this will not be aided by us acquising to it being kept it in stasis.
<br />
<br />
Having delved deeply into the documents, I am left with two questions:
<br />
<br /> 1. How do I take digital images of dermatological conditions under the current rules?
<br /> 2. How do I improve the policies so I can capture and manage such images efficiently?
<br />
<br />
In the short-term, my practice is planning to get an iPad so we can use 
Vision-360 on ward-rounds at care-homes. The 
2016 "Policy on Recordings (Photography and Video) for Clinical and Service Use"
does seem to feature a path where-by equipment must be registered and can then be used to capture images. 
The path isn't clear. The policy's Change Record does note that 'procedure' aspects have been removed 
to reduce the size of the document. Are you aware of another resource that better explains the procedure? 
<br />
<br />
This system is not as efficient as it should be. I've reviewed previous versions of
policies on recordings (<a href="http://www.nhslothian.scot.nhs.uk/YourRights/FOI/RequestAndResponseRegister/FOI%20Archive/1001_foi.pdf">
2008</a> and <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=9&ved=0ahUKEwiCyPXy07_TAhWJBsAKHdTBAhYQFghXMAg&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imi.org.uk%2Ffile%2Fdownload%2F3140%2F&usg=AFQjCNFnmt2T2Nf0-itI4vl1-eR0QKgRtA&sig2=0FKr_tyyShyJokKJJlI1Ug">
2011</a>). The trend in these documents is that the Medical Illustration teams, part of Secondary Care, are
arrogating more responsibilities to themselves. This correlates with a rising disregard for the needs of 
doctors and patients at the Primary Care level (the recognition that Primary Care even exists is expunged in 2016).
The recent increase in quality and ubiquity of everyday tehnology seems to be ignored entirely. It is worth noting that the policy
seems to have been produced without input from GPs or patient advocacy groups. 
General Practitioners are not even on the distribution list. 
Clearly, making policy is easy i.e. a ban on mobile phones was introduced 10 or more years ago. Unfortunately improving it
e.g. recognising that smart phones provide opportunties, is less attractive to policy makers.
<br />
<br />
Essentially, the data-protection thrust of the policies is quite reasonable. There is scant regard for clinical outcomes, the 
				approach taken to consent is unusual for General Practice, and the method of implementation is
entirely inappropriate for 2017. The idea that best practice should be to have an additional
piece of kit, to spend time physically plugging it in and out of other equipment, to move and manage patient data by
hand is ridiculous: it is ineffiecient, laborious and error-prone. 
I want to commision an efficient imaging-app for my smart phone that I can use to improve care of my patients while adhering
				to the eHealth Security Policy. How can you help me do this?
<br />
<br />
I think what we are aiming to do is well within the scope of <a href="http://www.gov.scot/Resource/0049/00494144.pdf">A National Clinical Strategy for Scotland</a>.
				I hope you are able to help, or at least point me in the right direction.
<br />
<br />
yours,

p.s. I have tired to keep this short...but I think it worth dropping this reference (although academic work in this area seems quite thin)
