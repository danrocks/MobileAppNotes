		<h1>European Health app rules</h1>

<p>
Initial source of information is this:
<a href='https://www.digitalhealth.net/2016/09/explainer-when-is-an-app-not-an-app-but-a-medical-device/'> </a>
</p>

<p>
	In the UK, apps seemed to be governed by the MHRA (Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency)
</p>

<p>
MRHA has a couple of interesting sites first is a list of manufacturers:
<a href='https://www.digitalhealth.net/2016/09/explainer-when-is-an-app-not-an-app-but-a-medical-device/'> </a>
<br /> And then they have guidance on what regulations might apply: <a href='https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/564745/Software_flow_chart_Ed_1-02.pdf'> </a>
</p>
<p>
For tools that would not be classed as medical devices National Information Board&apos;s Workstream 1.2: <a href='https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/467065/Work_stream_1.2_with_TCs.pdf'> </a>
</p>

<p>
There is degree of blur over what is a medical device and what is a &quot;clinical decision support tool&quot;. MyVirtualCLinic is  a recording device, so no need a CE mark as per the Medical Device Directives.
</p>
<p>
There are three Medical Device Directives. These have Annexes, some of which are particularly relevant. Some people have put up blogs with further guidance:
<a href='http://medicaldeviceacademy.com/essential-requirements-for-medical-device-ce-marking/'> </a>.
<br />
Annoyingly, these seem to be replaced by a Medical Device Regulation (MDR) in 2016
</p>
Companys such as Conformance seem to make a business fro CE compliance: <a href='http://www.conformance.co.uk/index.php'></a>
<p>

Key directives are:
<ul><li>Directive 90/385/EEC regarding active implantable medical devices (AIMD) 
</li><li><a href='http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:1993L0042:20071011:EN:PDF'>Directive 93/42/EEC</a> regarding medical devices (MDD)
</li><li>Directive 98/79/EC regarding in vitro diagnostic medical devices (IVDD)
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
MDD is the main one. MRHA guidance indicates some annexes are particularly key:
<ul>
<li>Annex IX - Classification</li>
<li>Annex I - essential requirements</li>
<li>Annex X - demonstration of conformity with the essential requirements must include a clinical evaluation.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
There is also "relevant harmonised standards" which may be used to demonstrate how many of the requirements have been met.
</p>
<p>
The EC does provide some further <a href='http://ec.europa.eu/growth/single-market/european-standards/harmonised-standards/medical-devices/'>guidance</a> around medical devices and CE marks:
<ul>
<li><a href='https://ec.europa.eu/growth/single-market/ce-marking/manufacturers'>Guidance on CE marking for professionals</a></li>
<li><a href='https://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/medical-devices/guidance'>Guidelines released to medical devices directives</a></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
There is a good introductory video to the CE process here : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArjCWkbI0_w&list=PL-GbGd06OZXlOgDnvvAGvwZcu1Sse5ahg"> </a>
</>
<p>
Notified Bodies are the groups who carry out "Conformity Assessments". I don't think one will be required for a Class 1 device such as MyVirtualClinic. There is a good video here though: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1lCr0gUUhE"> </a>  
</p>
<p>
A more in-depth video, from TheEmergoGroup is  here:

<li>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsVIhrhxexg">Overview</a>
<li>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbAQgVcwWAA">Classification</a> (Annes IX). Tis video focuses on hardware- perhaps it would not consider an app a Medical Device.
<li>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMnxFZDUZxU">Technical File</a> e.g. STED format including Essential Requirements, Risk Analysis(ISO 14971), and Clinical Evaluation. MEDDEVS provide further guidance on each of the 8 sections

</ol>
</p>
In the Uk the MHRO is the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/register-as-a-manufacturer-to-sell-medical-devices">Competent Authority</a>. 
		This web-site only uses hardware in it's examples. However it does link through to the European Commission's MEDDEV site where "<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/DocsRoom/documents/17921/attachments/1/translations">MEDDEV 2.1/6</a> 
		Qualification of and Classification of stand alone software" is worth a read. It gives extensive examples but doesn't directly address basic imaging like mine. If it's just recording information its not a medical device. But if used for monitoring, it is. 

<p>
Steps to follow to get a CE mark would be:
<ol>
<li>Complete Technical File - dossier with information about product and providing proof of compliance with applicable requirements</li>
<li>I have an EU office, so don't need an authorised representative</li>
<li>All Class 1 devices must be registered. I think this should be with the Competent Authority. Each EU country sets up it's own Competent Authority to comply with directive. The oversee enforcement of rules</li>
<li>Finalise Declaration of Conformity</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<h2>Technical Files</h2>
Video on Technical Files are available at:
<ol>
<li>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zUcrtzXlCA"> </a>(3mins)
<li>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrYolraPfQQ"> </a>(5mins)
<li>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rDeHFZJ1fE">How to review a technical file </a>(27mins) (from Phoenix group)
</ol>
Files should reference harmonised standards,
</p>
<p>
Classification other than Class 1 non-sterile require a Quality Management System be implemented. Generally this involves implementing ISO-13485.

<h2>Testing</h2>
Smart cost effective testing medical device testing starts with a good software requirements doc. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NJe4Xfibw8"></a>
