<h1>AppStore Releasing</h1>
<p>On this page I'm trying to list details about how to release to Appstore and the hoops that must be gone through.</p>
<p>Apple's notes on Application Distribution Workflows are here: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html"> </a></p>
<p>Note that the above focuses on XCode but I am using Xamarin. Specific guidelines for Xamarin are here <a href="https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/ios/deployment,_testing,_and_metrics/app_distribution/app-store-distribution/publishing_to_the_app_store/">Publishing to the App Store</a></p>
<p><a href="https://itunesconnect.apple.com/login?targetUrl=%2FWebObjects%2FiTunesConnect.woa&authResult=FAILED">iTunes Connect</a>
		is also an important suite of web based tools - it manages IoS apps on te App Store and xamarin.iOs app will need properly set-up on this.
</p>
<p>
	Initial tasks are:
	<ol>
		<li>Prepare app for distribution: Before you distribute your app for testing or submit it to the store for approval, complete the configuration of your Xcode project. Your final Xcode project should contain required app icons and launch images, and specify which devices and operating systems your app supports.
		<li>Test Apps on Numerous Devices and Releases
		<li>Submit and Release app on store			
	</ol>
</p>
<p>
	I started by setting up iTunes Connect and it's "Prepare for Submission" feature. This includes adding the bundle Id (from Info.plist) and a sku (stock keeping unit) which i generated based on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5449774/how-to-get-sku-number">this</a>
	There are a number of other things still to do, such as setting up a contract, supplying images and screen-shots, and providing web links to privacy pages etc. 
</p>
<p>
	Once paper-work is done actually have to 'package' the code - these seem to be the 
		<a href="https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/ios/deployment,_testing,_and_metrics/app_distribution/app-store-distribution/publishing_to_the_app_store/#Building_and_Submitting_the_Distributable">instructions</a>
for Xamarin.
</p>


<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>There are four types of <a href="https://www.codeproject.com/Tips/351122/What-is-software-testing-What-are-the-different-ty">testing</a> I want to get done:
<ul>
	<li> Unit testing
	<li> Integration Testing
	<li> System Testing - apple's guidance is <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/TestingYouriOSApp/TestingYouriOSApp.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012582-CH8-SW1">Exporting your App for Testing</a>.
			Set-up steps are 
				<ol>
					<li> Register all test devices - <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/MaintainingProfiles/MaintainingProfiles.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012582-CH30-SW10">Registering Devices Using Your Developer Account</a>. 
						For maria's old Iphone, I used iTunes to find the device id.
						<li> Archive your app - Initial set-up (get signing certificate, project set-up) is outlined at
							<a href="https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/ios/deployment,_testing,_and_metrics/app_distribution/ad-hoc-distribution/">Ad-Hoc Distribution</a> 
							(iOs, Xamarin). iTunes Connect/Testflight is an alternative route for beta testing but is not availble to users like me.
						<br />
						It is then necessary to create a .ipa (the iPhone application archive file - it stores as Iphone app as a compressed binary for ARM architecture
						 so can only be installed on IPhone, IPad etc. Can be decompressed by changing .ipa to .zip. Cannot be run on simulator because they contain no binary for x86 architecture),
						which is discussed at 
						<a href="https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/ios/deployment,_testing,_and_metrics/app_distribution/ipa_support/">IPA Support</a>.
						This page states <q>a small iTunesMetadata.plist file is created everytime you build your project and is stored in your project directory</q>. 
						I cannot see this file. There are links 
						<a href="https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/ios/deployment,_testing,_and_metrics/app_distribution_overview/itunesmetadata/#iTunesMetadata_contents">The iTunesMetadata.plist Contents </a> 
						and 
						<a href="https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/ios/deployment,_testing,_and_metrics/app_distribution_overview/itunesmetadata/#iTunesMetadata_creating"> Creating an iTunesMetadata.plist File</a>.
						Frustratingly these links both 404.
						<br />
						Next, is the requirement to have some sort of icons available for use by itunes.
						<br />
						Eventually there instructions for "Creating an IPA". Unfortunately, the instructions target Xamarin Studio on a Mac rather than Vs on Windows.
						<br />
						There is an Archive option in Build menu, but it is disabled....does <a href="https://forums.xamarin.com/discussion/10746/how-to-build-an-adhoc-ipa-file-for-an-ios-app-in-visual-studio-2012-asked-and-answered">this</a> 
						help? Yes it does key stetps are:
							<ol>
								<li>Set Configuration to Ad-Hoc in Solution Configuration/ Project iOS build.
								<li>Set Project iOS Application
								<li>Rebuild Solution
								<li>View .ipa on Mac via Visual Studio's Tools>iOS>Show IPA Files on Build Server.
							</ol>
						I also had to upgrade nuget packages (not sure why) and reboot iOs to avoid weird android bug (despite Androidnot being Configured to build) and get the Xamarin Mac Agent working.
						iTunesMetadata.plist is created on the build server.

						<li> Export the archive using either an ad hoc provisioning profile or team provisioning profile to code sign your app.
							</li>
						<li> Install the app on test devices. Exactly how a device should access the Adhoc Distribution file is not exactly clear. 
						It can be drag and dropped on to iTunes. I found 
						<a href="http://mobiledan.net/2012/03/02/5-options-for-distributing-ios-apps-to-a-limited-audience-legally/">this</a> very useful and copied .ipa to shared drive on maria's machine.

<h2>Medical Apps</h2>	
<p>I am releasing an app that is in some way related to health, so will have to follow the stringent health related guidelines that apple have.</p>

		
<p>A synopsis is here: <a href="http://www.mobihealthnews.com/content/apples-updated-app-store-guidelines-place-added-scrutiny-health-medical-apps">MobileHealthNews</a> 
</p>
<p>Guidlines are at: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#health-and-health-research">App Store Review Guidelines</a></p>
<p>The medical guidelines are not really aimed at a tool like MyVirtualClinic - it is not doing human subject research and doesn't use HealthKit</p>
<p>However some other rules will be relevant:
<ul>
	<li>5.1.1 - Data Collection &amp; Storage - will need a privacy poincy simple because there isa login involved. 
	<li>5.1.2 - Data Use &amp; Sharing - Apps cannot use or transmit someoneâ€™s personal data without first obtaining their permission and providing access to information about how and where the data will be used.
 			
</ul>

<p>Guidlines are at: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#health-and-health-research">App Store Review Guidelines</a></p>
